        <p class="paragraph">I am a software engineer specializing in native iOS development, game development with Unity 3D and Augmented Reality. I have worked on over 20+ projects including iOS mobile applications, PC games, Augmented Reality, and websites.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The solutions that I produce is of the highest quality conforming to <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/10-groups-software-quality">Software Quality Factors</a>. They are also responsive, looks great on different devices, and tested.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I started programming 5 years ago during my degree (Computer Games Development) with Java, C, C++, and C#. The goals were to have a solid programming foundation, getting a grasp of Object Oriented Programming and to have more diverse knowledge of games development including 3D modeling in 3Ds Max, creating sound effects in FL studio, and project management.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I completed a Master in Software Engineering in which I learn more about software quality and deeper knowledge in project management. During that time, I have also earned Microsoft Certification for Web Applications (MCSA) which demonstrated my skills to develop modern web applications and also earned Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions Certification.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I started iOS development in 2017 using Swift to create native iPhone or iPad apps. I prefer Swift over Objective C because of its simplicity which reduces boilerplate codes. Hence, greatly reduce app development time. I still do work with Objective-C from time to time when using third-party libraries. I am using the useful features provided in Swift such as protocols, enums, delegates, generics on daily basis. The tools that I usually use includes Xcode, Unity, Vuforia, Sourcetree, Cocoapods, Postman, and Sublime Text.</p> 

        <p class="paragraph">As an iOS developer, I have to integrate the app with back-end in which most of the time I am using AlamoFire library to retrieve REST API or JSON. I have also used Firebase for authentications, push notifications, database and analytics. I am providing Augmented Reality solutions by using Vuforia in Unity 3D. If you are interested, please check out my portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>. Currently, some of my latest projects cannot be showcased as per non-disclosure agreement.</p>
